The following code implements a queue using a stack. To push a value, just push(value). When popping a value, we first check if the stack is empty we return. Otherwise we can get the top value and push it in the stack. This 
is repeated using recurrsion until the stack empty. Then we return the top value (which is the proper value from the prespective of a queue). The empty function checks if the stack is empty using the ".empty()" function.
