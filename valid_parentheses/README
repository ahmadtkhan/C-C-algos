Checks whether the parentheses is opened and closed in the proper order. 
A for loop is used to iterate over the string. If the letter is an opening bracket, we push it. If the string has a space, we return false. If any other scenario, the letter is compared with the opening bracket on the top of
stack (the latest one). If they match we pop that value from the stack. Else return false and it the parantheses is not valid.
