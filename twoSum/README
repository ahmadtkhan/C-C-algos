The following code takes in an array and returns the index of the number which adds up to the sum of another number in the array. 
To decrease the time complexity from worst case n^2 (adding all the combinations up) to n, the target is subtracted we use an unordered map. When go through the array if a particular element is not in the map we add it in.
Then target - nums[i] should already be there in the map. This way we only have to go through the array once.
